# fcp-sfd-performance-test-suite

A JMeter based test runner for the CDP Platform.

  - [About the licence](#about-the-licence)

## Build

Test suites are built automatically by the [.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) action whenever a change are committed to the `main` branch.
A successful build results in a Docker container that is capable of running your tests on the CDP Platform and publishing the results to the CDP Portal.

## Run

The performance test suites are designed to be run from the CDP Portal.
The CDP Platform runs test suites in much the same way it runs any other service, it takes a docker image and runs it as an ECS task, automatically provisioning infrastructure as required.

## Local Testing with Docker Compose

You can run the entire performance test stack locally using Docker Compose, including LocalStack, Redis, and the target service. This is useful for development, integration testing, or verifying your test scripts **before committing to `main`**, which will trigger GitHub Actions to build and publish the Docker image.

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache development
```

This ensures any changes to `entrypoint.sh` or other scripts are picked up properly.

---

### Start the full test stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This brings up:

* `development`: the container that runs your performance tests
* `localstack`: simulates AWS S3, SNS, SQS, etc.
* `redis`: backing service for cache
* `service`: the application under test

Once all services are healthy, your performance tests will automatically start.

---

### Replace `service-name` in Compose File

In the `docker-compose.yml`, make sure to replace:

```yaml
image: defradigital/service-name:${SERVICE_VERSION:-latest}
```

with the actual name of your serviceâ€™s image.

This is the service under test, which must expose a `/health` endpoint and listen on port `3000`.

---

### Notes

* S3 bucket is expected to be `s3://test-results`, automatically created inside LocalStack.
* Logs and reports are written to `./reports` on your host.
* `entrypoint.sh` should contain the logic to wait for dependencies and kick off the test run.
* The `depends_on` healthchecks ensure services like `localstack` and `service` are ready before tests start.
* If you make changes to test scripts or entrypoints, rerun with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Local Testing with LocalStack

### Build a new Docker image
```
docker build . -t my-performance-tests
```
### Create a Localstack bucket
```
aws --endpoint-url=localhost:4566 s3 mb s3://my-bucket
```

### Run performance tests

```
docker run \
-e S3_ENDPOINT='http://host.docker.internal:4566' \
-e RESULTS_OUTPUT_S3_PATH='s3://my-bucket' \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='test' \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='test' \
-e AWS_SECRET_KEY='test' \
-e AWS_REGION='eu-west-2' \
my-performance-tests
```

docker run -e S3_ENDPOINT='http://host.docker.internal:4566' -e RESULTS_OUTPUT_S3_PATH='s3://cdp-infra-dev-test-results/cdp-portal-perf-tests/95a01432-8f47-40d2-8233-76514da2236a' -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='test' -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='test' -e AWS_SECRET_KEY='test' -e AWS_REGION='eu-west-2' -e ENVIRONMENT='perf-test' my-performance-tests
